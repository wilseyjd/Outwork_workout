Build a mobile-first web app called Outwork — Workout to plan and track workouts and supplements. Use the attached files as the source of truth:

Outwork_Workout_PRD_FINAL.md (PRD)

Outwork_Supabase_Model_v1.md (data model)

Tech stack requirements

Frontend: React (prefer Next.js App Router if supported; otherwise React + Vite is fine)

Backend/DB: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

Styling: Tailwind (preferred) or simple CSS modules

Mobile-first UX: optimized for phone usage, quick logging, large tap targets

Privacy-first: no social features

Core product concept

Implement the distinction between:

Planned Workouts = workout templates with planned exercises + planned sets (targets)

Performed Workouts = workout sessions created when a user starts a workout; sessions store actual sets performed

Must-have MVP features
Authentication

Supabase email/password login

Require auth for all app pages (redirect to login)

Exercises (Exercise Bank)

List exercises

Create / edit / delete exercise

Simple search/filter by name

Store per the model (name, category optional, notes optional)

Workout Templates (Planner)

List templates

Create / edit / delete templates

Add exercises to a template (ordered)

For each exercise in a template, define planned sets:

target reps (optional)

target weight (optional, lbs)

target time seconds (optional)

rest seconds (optional)

is_warmup flag

Schedule

Schedule a template to a day (simple calendar/list view for the week)

Mark schedule status: planned / completed / skipped

Workout Session (Execution / Logging)

“Today” screen shows today’s scheduled workout(s)

Start workout → creates a workout session and copies exercises into session_exercises

During workout:

For each exercise, log performed sets (actual weight/reps/time, rest, warmup)

Quick add set button

Editable after saving

Notes field for the session

Save/end session and mark linked schedule item as completed

History + Progress (Basic)

Workout history list (sessions)

“What did I lift last time?” per exercise:

On exercise detail screen show most recent performed sets for that exercise

Basic trend view is optional for v1, but “last time” is required

Supplements

CRUD supplements

Create supplement schedule (daily/weekly/custom simplified)

Log supplement intake

View supplement log history

Body Weight

Log body weight entries

View weight history list

Attachments (optional for v1, but scaffold)

Use Supabase Storage and attachments table to support images tied to workout sessions

If full UI is too much, at least implement the backend helper and a placeholder UI

Data & Supabase integration requirements

Follow the schema from Outwork_Supabase_Model_v1.md

Use Row Level Security (RLS) patterns described (user_id = auth.uid())

Include a supabaseClient setup and environment variable guidance:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

Provide a seed option or simple “Create sample exercises/templates” helper button (optional but helpful)

UI requirements (keep it simple but clean)

Mobile-first layout with bottom navigation:

Today

Plan

History

Supplements

Settings

Use a consistent card layout for workouts/exercises

Keep flows fast:

minimal modals

inline editing for sets if possible

Deliverables

Working app with the screens and flows above

Clear README:

how to set Supabase env vars

how to run locally in Replit

how to apply database schema (SQL migration file or instructions)

Provide a supabase_migration.sql file that creates tables, indexes, enums (if used), and basic RLS policies aligned to the model

Build plan (do this in steps)

Scaffold app + auth + protected routes

Implement Exercise Bank CRUD

Implement Template builder + planned sets

Implement Scheduling

Implement Session logging flow (start → log sets → save/end)

Implement History + “last time”

Implement Supplements + logging

Implement Body weight logs

Add polish + error states + loading states

If something in the PRD conflicts with the model, ask me which to follow. Otherwise, proceed using the PRD as product truth and the model as database truth.
